        <h2 class="size">What are Internships</h2>
        Internships are crucial for students as they offer practical experience, skill development, industry exposure, and networking opportunities. They help students apply classroom knowledge
         to real-world situations, enhancing problem-solving abilities. Internships also allow students to explore different career options, build professional networks, and improve employability.
          By bridging the gap between academia and the workforce, internships facilitate a smoother transition and contribute to personal and professional growth, ultimately increasing the chances
           of securing desired job opportunities after graduation.

      <h2 class="size">What are Projects</h2>
      Projects can serve as a way to showcase your skills and capabilities. Taking on projects allows individuals to demonstrate their abilities, problem-solving skills, and expertise in a practical setting.
      As a project participant, you have the opportunity to define project goals, timelines, and resource allocation based on the project's requirements and constraints. This flexibility allows you to exercise
       creativity and adaptability in finding solutions and managing the project effectively. Successfully completing projects can provide evidence of your skills and contribute to building a portfolio or resume.
