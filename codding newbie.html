      <h2 class="size">Basic Languages for Coding</h2>
      Now that you have a basic idea about coding and its importance, let's talk about some of the most popular programming languages that you can start learning. Some of the basic programming languages include C, C++, Java, and Python. Each language
       has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For instance, C and C++ are fast and efficient, but they are also more complex compared to other languages like Python, which is easier to learn and read. Java, on the other hand, is widely used
        for developing enterprise applications and Android apps. Whatever language you choose, the key is to stick with it and practice, practice, practice!
